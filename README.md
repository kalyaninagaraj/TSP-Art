# TSP-Art a la Robert Bosch
Continuous-line drawings interpreted as solutions to the traveling salesman problem

## About
This repository is home to Python code that approximates a given `.pbm` image with a continuous-line drawing that is a solution to a [traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
